This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation).

This exists to enable [uk_planning_scraper](https://github.com/adrianshort/uk_planning_scraper) to be tested in the Morph environment, giving us some degree of [dev/prod parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity).
